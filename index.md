**Hi!** My name is Chaitanya Nettem. I'm a Freelance Developer. Most of my work involves Python for backend development and Java/Android for mobile app development. I'm a polyglot who is proficient in Java, Python & C++.

I'm *actively* seeking full-time positions which will involve work in some combination of full stack, Android, networking and distributed systems.

### Some recent projects -

* [Search for Reddit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=chaitanya.im.searchforreddit): Check for reposts/find past Reddit threads and search Reddit for anything.

* [Peer-peer file sharing application](https://github.com/chaitanyanettem/file-sharer): Created a client server application in **C++** which performs asynchronous I/O and allows multiple simultaneous connections using epoll.

* **Multi-Interface Connectivity in Android**: Worked on changes to the `ConnectivityService` component of the Android Framework and the `HttpURLConnection` library to enable concurrent use of 3G/4G and WiFi radios.

* [Amazon Dynamo style distributed key-value store](https://github.com/chaitanyanettem/dynamo): Implemented a simplified version of Amazon Dynamo in the form of a group messenger in **Android**.

* [Book price comparison engine - JustCompare](https://github.com/chaitanyanettem/justcompare): Created search engine for book prices in Indian retail sites. Involved scraping a *lot* of data using **Python** and using the full-text search capabilities of **Postgres**.

### Talks and Presentations -

* [Jack, Jill and Java 8](https://droidconin.talkfunnel.com/2016/114-jack-jill-java-8): Presented a talk on the new Jack & Jill toolchain for Android at Droidcon, Bangalore 2016.

* [Fall detector with Raspberry Pi](https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/presentation/104): Implemented a fall detector using a Raspberry Pi and a USB camera to detect falling objects. Presented a poster on this project at **PyCon 2014**.

## A bit more about me

I was born in Bellary, India. I have lived for significant amounts of time in Baroda, Noida, Bangalore and Buffalo in that order. Out of those I think I loved Bangalore the most.

I love to read and I cannot live without music (Janis Joplin's <a href="https://youtu.be/A24JZkgvNv4" target="_blank">Summertime</a> is a current favorite).
